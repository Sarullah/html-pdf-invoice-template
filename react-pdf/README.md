# React to PDF Invoice

This example uses React and styled-components to generate an invoice PDF. You can use this as a jumping off point to generate a PDF with your own custom React / styled-components code.

To run it, `yarn install` at the root of this repo, then run:

```sh
ANVIL_API_TOKEN=your_token yarn react:generate-pdf && open ./generate-react.output.pdf
```

See the [generate-pdf.js](./generate-pdf.js) script, and `components` directory here for the code.
